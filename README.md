**Sound for Aging: A Non-Invasive Audio Therapy
**

**Project Overview
**
Sound for Aging is a mobile app designed to provide non-invasive audio-based therapy for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The app leverages the power of 40Hz gamma wave stimulation to potentially slow cognitive decline.

**Key Features:
**
    40Hz Audio Therapy: Delivers therapeutic sound pulses at 40Hz to stimulate gamma wave activity in the brain.
    Customizable Experience: Allows users to adjust the intensity of the therapy through a pulse elongation slider.
    40Hz Modulated Music: Enables users to listen to their preferred music while subtly incorporating 40Hz pulses.
    Imperceptible Audio Pulse: Delivers 40Hz therapy through a background noise masking technique, ensuring a comfortable listening experience.

**How it Works:
**
    Gamma Wave Stimulation: The app generates 40Hz audio pulses, which are known to stimulate gamma wave activity in the brain.
    Cognitive Benefits: Increased gamma wave activity can potentially slow cognitive decline and improve memory and attention.
    User-Friendly Interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and customization.

**Scientific Basis:
**
Numerous studies have shown the potential benefits of gamma wave stimulation for cognitive health. By using sound-based therapy, Sound for Aging aims to provide an accessible and effective solution for individuals with dementia.

**Future Development:
**
    Personalized Therapy: Explore personalized therapy plans based on individual needs and preferences.
    Advanced Features: Integrate additional features such as progress tracking, reminders, and integration with other health apps.
    Clinical Trials: Conduct rigorous clinical trials to further validate the efficacy of the app.
